  <h1 class="red-glow">WHY NOT ME.</h1>
  <p class="white">
    Wasn’t it a great brand that once said<br>
    “Don’t ask if your dreams are crazy. Ask if they’re crazy enough.”
  </p>
  <p class="blue-glow">I did. And here we are.</p>

  <h2 class="white">This is what I look like:</h2>
  <div class="portrait-words">
    <span>Curious.</span>
    <span>Commercially serious.</span>
    <span>Culturally awake.</span>
    <span>Calm under pressure.</span>
    <span>Slightly stubborn.</span>
  </div>
  <p class="blue-glow">That’s enough.</p>

    <h2>This wasn’t supposed to be sent here.</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This was supposed to be sent to adidas. It isn’t.</p>
      <p>Because I think Nike is cooler.</p>
      <p>If you’re going to take a swing, you might as well aim properly.</p>

  <div class="toggle">
    <h2>I don’t have the required years.</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Pattern recognition.</p>
      <p>Marketplace instinct.</p>
      <p>Commercial accountability.</p>
      <p>Enough audacity to build a website instead of writing another cover letter.</p>
      <p class="red-glow">Years are a proxy. I optimise for signal.</p>

  <div class="toggle">
    <h2>My tech experience includes doomscrolling, UPI payments, adding to cart and online shopping.</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>And yet here I am building this.</p>
      <p>Initiative beats comfort zones.</p>
      <p>Understanding how people browse, hesitate, compare, abandon and finally checkout is half the job.</p>

  <div class="toggle">
    <h2>I am obsessed with stories.</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Books. Reddit threads at 2am. People explaining why they bought something they did not need.</p>
      <p class="red-glow">Marketplace is storytelling with checkout buttons.</p>
      <p>The best products do not just sell. They signal.</p>

  <div class="toggle">
    <h2>I like dogs. Yes, I am basic.</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Specifically the slightly derpy, tongue-out, no-thoughts-just-vibes kind.</p>
      <p>I notice emotional signals. I value loyalty. I believe consistency builds trust.</p>

  <div class="toggle">
    <h2>I plan holidays like product launches.</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Budget. Experience map. Contingencies. Backup airport snacks.</p>

      <p class="red-glow">Chaos is overrated.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="toggle">
    <h2>What I bring to the table.</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Marketplace thinking beyond listings.</p>
      <p>Comfort owning revenue, not just reach.</p>
      <p>Paid and platform integration instinct.</p>
      <p>Ability to zoom out and zoom in.</p>
      <p>Structured experimentation muscle.</p>
      <p>Cross functional fluency.</p>
      <p>Calm under commercial pressure.</p>
      <p class="blue-glow">And yes, audacity.</p>
